# msi-extractor
A very simple PS1 script that extracts MSI's.

# Notes
The output select dialog opens behind Powershell, I cant fix this without writing my own GUI, so this is the best you'll get.

# How to run
1) Download the `msi-extractor.exe` from the Releases tab, and run the file. Follow the prompts.
If you have any issues make a Issue on this repo.

# Dislaimer
This script does not work on all MSIs. Notibly VNC Server. Not really sure why to be honest.
